Mod Information
=======

This mod reworks a couple mechanics regarding both KeepInventory and the XP bar, which
said changes are as follows:

Sets the default value when creating a world for the keepInventory Gamerule to true.

The keepInventory Gamerule no longer keeps experience.

Added the keepExperience Gamerule, which keeps experience on death.

The required amount of experience needed to level up for each level is now fixed
per level, and set to a value of 36 experience per level.

Whenever dying and losing experience, the amount of experience dropped is now equal
to the same amount of xp as you had prior to death

The changes done are intended as a balancing factor for other mods/parts of the 
overall mod this is intended to be part of, and as thus are less effective in their
goals and balancing on their own.
